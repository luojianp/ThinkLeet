The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of
gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
2.1 数组31
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note:
• For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
• For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
• For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

解法：衍生由n-1翻番生成n，时间复杂度 o(n2) ,空间复杂度o(n)
而没有给其他的用。


变式：
（1）数1,2不断的生成新的序列。（3.12 Count and Say(本质是run -length encoding压缩的原理)）
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2", then "one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string
时间复杂度o(n2)，空间复杂度o(n)


并行化：
当内存无法hold所有分区，则由分区之间翻番然后最高位附加0,或者1，然后每个分区都是本地翻番，主节点控制元数据信息，这个分区位于总的结果的
哪个位置。
