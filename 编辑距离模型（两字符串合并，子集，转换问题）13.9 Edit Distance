（1）两字符串交叉合并：13.6 Interleaving String
Given s1; s2; s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.
For example, Given: s1 = ”aabcc”, s2 = ”dbbca”,
When s3 = ”aadbbcbcac”, return true.
When s3 = ”aadbbbaccc”, return false.

（2）不同子集序列（很类似编辑距离中的一种情况，即删除情况）T为S13.11 Distinct Subsequences
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can
be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is
a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
Here is an example: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Return 3.
